# What is Dynamically Typed Language

- Types are associated with values not variables
- The same variable can hold multiple types
- We do not need to specify types
- Most other languages are statically typed (Java, C#, C++)
- There ar supersets of JS and addons to allow static typing (TypeScript, Flow)
