In programming, the term "scope" refers to the context in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be accessed. Essentially, it determines the accessibility of variables to other parts of your code. In JavaScript, there are mainly two types of scope:

Global Scope:

A variable declared outside any function or block has a global scope.
It is accessible from any part of the code, including within functions and blocks.
Overuse of global variables can lead to conflicts and bugs, especially in larger applications, because any part of the script can change a global variable.
Local Scope:

This can be divided into two categories: function scope and block scope.
Function scope is specific to var declarations. Variables declared with var inside a function are only accessible within that function and are not visible outside of it.
Block scope is specific to let and const declarations. Variables declared with let or const inside a block (denoted by curly braces {}) are only accessible within that block and are not visible outside of it.
Example of Global Scope:

javascript
Copy code
var globalVar = "I am global";

function test() {
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
}

if (true) {
    console.log(globalVar); // Also accessible here
}
Example of Local Scope (Function Scope with var):

javascript
Copy code
function test() {
    var localVar = "I am local to test function";
    console.log(localVar); // Accessible here
}

test();
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
Example of Local Scope (Block Scope with let/const):

javascript
Copy code
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I am local to this block";
    console.log(blockVar); // Accessible here
}

console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
Understanding scope is crucial for writing reliable and maintainable code, as it helps in managing where and how variables can be accessed or modified.
